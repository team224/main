Robotics Website

Hello, this is the team website. As you can see we are really hardcore and its not a weebly, but is actual code.
I created this website so that I could have more control over how it looks and works. This website is written in
3 web programming languages: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Nothing is organized at all and im sorry lol. The website
is hosted through Github Pages and FYI I think they use Apache webservers :( If you want to be even more hardcore,
you can host it on your own computer or raspberry pi or something! Anyways, here are the details of how to code
the website. First, you should get an understanding of how HTML, JavaScript, and CSS works. HTML is so simple 
I dont consider it to be a programming language. Next you should know that the elements on this website are part
of a library called Materialize CSS which uses Google's Material Design, so you might want to read this:
http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/ and also look at this http://materializecss.com/ Furthermore, design and aesthetic
are more important than winning or even having a fully functioning webpage so dont screw it up. I am also a designer
and 3d animator, I recommend you learn how to use Adobe Illustrator for graphics, Adobe After Effects for simple 
2d graphics, and Cinema4D for actual 3d animating. I dont think our website uses any 3d graphics at the moment (I 
was working on some interactive flash graphics but FYI flash is over now so I would probably do it again in JS) 
but its good to know if you want to do the animation award. My usual IDE is WebStorm because DreamWeaver is crap.
Gif is pronounced with the g sound because it stands for Graphical Interchange Format, not Jraphical. When you need
to convert a video you make in after effects or that you take with a camera or whatever into a gif, use photoshop
and save as legacy for the web; do not use Media encoder for this because it spits out garbage with huge filesizes.
Thats pretty much it. Just read the source code and have fun. There are some deactivated parts of the website as it
has changed over time, so be sure to read all the comments you come across. I recommend you start at index.html,
which is the main webpage. Please do not try to read the super long CSS files, you will die before you even get to
scroll to the end. Chrome's developer tools are great for planning out changes to the CSS and HTML without having to
read everything. Good Luck.
