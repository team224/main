<p>On Saturday we will be heading to Ramp Riot for our competition. Please come to the Piscataway High School bus loop at <b><font color="red">6:15 AM sharp</b></font>, or you will miss the bus. If you plan to come you must have a permission slip turned in or bring one onto the bus day of. We will be arriving back at school around 7 or 8 PM so you will need someone to pick you up at Piscataway High School. Please be sure to pack a lunch or bring money to buy food as food wonâ€™t be provided. If you have your own pair of safety glasses please bring them, you will need to wear safety glasses in the pit and there is a limited supply if you do not have any. Team Spirit is important! We will be giving out shirts, but wear our school colors just in case.
